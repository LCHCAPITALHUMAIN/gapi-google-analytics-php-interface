= Using the GAPI filter control =

The GAPI filter control is designed to making filtering with the Google Analytics API easier - through the use of normal PHP operators for AND and OR, and the translation of metrics and parameters to the correct Google Analytics namespaced versions.

The Google Analytics API has a small amount of documentation on using the Google Analytics API filter control at the [http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReference.html#filtering Google Analytics API reference].

The most frustrating aspect of the Google Analytics API filter control is that Google hasn't yet offered any operators to specify precedence. Where we would normally use ( and ) in PHP, we can't do anything in our filters here. To allow the sensible use of OR in the filter control, they have given the OR operator a higher precedence than AND.

For example, where we would normally write:

country == 'United States' && ( browser == 'Firefox || browser == 'Chrome')

This would be represented in a GAPI filter string by:

country == 'United States' && browser == 'Firefox || browser == 'Chrome'

== Valid Operators for filtering ==

As seen on the [http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReference.html#filtering Google Analytics API reference], there are six operators for metrics and six operators for dimensions. The GAPI interface allows you to use all six operators.
